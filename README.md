## My process
- started with designing the mobile and screens below 767px design first as both are the same 
- then started to work my my out to the larger screens by using media queries
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (was an option but was not intentionally needed)
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

### Useful resources
